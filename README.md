## Features
### Search
GroupMe Desktop Client offers comprehensive, offline searching functionality. Messages are automatically downloaded and indexed in the background, allowing for a variety of search filters and speedy performance.  
 
Search results can easily be viewed in-context, and attachments and images can easily be copied, saved, or shared.

### Plugins
GroupMe Desktop Client is highly extensible through its open source plugin system. Plugins can operate in a variety of ways. For example, Message Effect Plugins can be used to help compose new messages to send, or can provide humorous suggestions based on what has been typed. More complex plugins can run in dedicated windows and can provide sophisticated functionality.

### Threaded Replies
Threaded Replies are natively supported when using GroupMe Desktop Client, and include an easy-to-read fallback option when viewing a conversation on a device that is not running GMDC. Threaded Replies allow for a message to quote an existing message or reply, and can be nested. When using GMDC, threaded replies are not images - they're fully functional copies of the original message. This allows for easy access to attachments, images, or social media posts in a conversation.

GroupMe Desktop Client supports displaying multiple chats simultaneously, side-by-side. The number of chats that can be opened both normally, and in collapsed-sidebar mode, is fully user configurable.

 ## Development Information
 GMDC is built using C#/WPF running on .NET Framework 4.7.2. All external dependencies are included as NuGet packages, so no special steps are required to build a copy of GMDC using Visual Studio. Visual Studio 2019 is recommended.

 [Squirrel](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows) is used for automatic updating and distribution. When building in Release mode, an installer will automatically be created. Current Release builds on GitHub are automatically released through GitHub Actions. The CreateRelease workflow is activated by pushing a tag, which is used to automatically number and release the build.

[GroupMeClientAvalonia](https://github.com/alexdillon/GroupMeClientAvalonia) is an experimental port of GMDC to the Avalonia platform to provide compatibility with Windows, Linux, and macOS. GMDCA is still highly-experimental and is not suitable for daily use. The goal is to directly port over as much of GMDC to GMDCA as possible.
